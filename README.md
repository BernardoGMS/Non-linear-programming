# Non-linear-programming
Optimization algorithms to optimize non-linear functions.

This work aims to solve nonlinear programming problems, using <strong>MATLAB</strong> whose statements are attached to the report.
Firstly, the goal is to implement an algorithm for solving a one-dimensional problem using the <strong>Golden Section Method</strong>.
For the following unconstrained two-dimensional problems, the resolution will be carried out using a series of methods that may or may not involve the search for the optimal solution using derivatives.
With regard to problems with constraints, both equality and inequality, the intention is to solve them considering an <strong>Augmented Lagrangian Formulation</strong> or a <strong>Penalty Formulation</strong>. The unconstrained function is then resolved using some methods already implemented for solving unconstrained problems.
Finally, the resolution of a three-dimensional problem is intended.
Additionally, throughout the work, depending on the problem, it is intended to write the necessary first and second-order conditions, and sufficient second-order conditions, or the <strong>KKT conditions</strong>, checking for some cases of obtained solutions if they satisfy such conditions.
